## 🍸🍽️Food and Drinks Website

This website is designed for Food and Drinks recipes for anyone who is looking for meals and cocktails. User will be presented with two search bars. Each search bar will give the ability to search recipes based on an ingredient of their choice. The main page will also have a box where saved recipes will be listed as links in order to give the ability to revisit the recipes as user saves them. The goal of the project is to create an easy to navigate website that has a polished and attractive design.
